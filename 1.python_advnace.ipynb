It aims to implement real-world entities \n","like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that \n","together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. \n","\n","OOP is about code reuse — you factor code to minimize redundancy and program by customizing what already exists instead of changing code in place or\n","starting from scratch.\n","'''"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n","'''\n","An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in the instance object, then in the class the instance was created from, then in all higher superclasses,\n","progressing from left to right (by default).
